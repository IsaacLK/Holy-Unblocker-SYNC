# Holy Unblocker website

# Who/What this repository is for

This repository contains the base Holy Unblocker website. This includes tools and dependencies used to compile the website (Webpack, React) and development tools (ESLint, Prettier).

This repository should not be ran alone. There are several dependencies that require configuration.

If you are a developer, this repository is ideal for testing commits and building for production.

If you are just looking to self-host/deploy Holy Unblocker, check out [website-aio](https://github.com/e9x/website-aio).

## Recommended VSC Extensions

- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

## Recommended Chromium extensions

Protections against clickjacking and CORS prevents the website running locally from interacting with other scripts such as Rammerhead. These extensions will circumvent these protections for development.

- [CORS unblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino)
- [Ignore X-Frame headers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ignore-x-frame-headers/gleekbfjekiniecknbkamfmkohkpodhe)
