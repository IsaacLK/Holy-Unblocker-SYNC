## Holy Unblocker - Cloned to Github from git.holy.how
# What is the purpose of this repository?
Holy Unblocker is self-hosted on git.holy.how. Personally, I like to have everything in one place, so I made this repo which updates from the git.holy.how repo every 5 minutes. This will only pull from the repo, and NOT push any changes back.

See original Holy Unblocker README.md [here.](HU-README.md)
